# Tetris in Assembly MIPS32

This game is being implemented as a requirement for the Organization and Architecture Of Computers Course (CIC 116394) offered by the University of Brasilia (Brazil). 

## Hardware requirements:
* Implement a MIPS32 CPU with pipeline

* Sound effects and music

* Game input to be collected through a IrDA receiver

The game should be fully working in the *[Altera DE2-70 board][DE2-70]*.

## Software requirements:
* A fully functioning Tetris game based on the original Tetris game

* Multiplayer options (1-4 players)

The game should be correctely simulated in the *[Mars][MARS]* application.
